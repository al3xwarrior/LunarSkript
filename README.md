LunarSkript

This is a Skript addon that allows you to use the LunarClient (Apollo) API to interact with users on your server running LunarClient. I plan on supporting other parts of the API in the future.

This addon requires:
Apollo (LunarClient API)​
Skript 2.9.2 (Tested on 2.9.2 should work on other versions)​

Supports the use of:
- Beams
- Staff Mods
- Notifications
- Nametags
- More Soon
